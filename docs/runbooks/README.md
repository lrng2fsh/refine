# Runbooks

Task-oriented guides for operating Refine, written to be followed by an AI
agent acting on a user's behalf (they work fine for people too). Each runbook
states its preconditions, the questions to ask the user before acting, the
commands to run, how to verify the outcome, and how to undo it.

Two commands make Refine self-navigating — reach for them before reading any
source code:

- `refine next` — inspects the current project and fleet state and recommends
  the next operations, each with the exact command to run. Call it whenever
  you are unsure what to do; call it again after acting.
- `refine commands` — a machine-readable JSON catalog of every CLI command
  with descriptions. Load it once instead of exploring `--help` per
  subcommand.

Runbooks:

- [Install Refine](install.md) — install or update Refine, configure an agent
  provider, start the daemon, and verify the result.
- [Operate development-request email intake](development-request-email.md) —
  connect the Fastmail `goal@getrefine.dev` mailbox to the active project,
  verify queued intake, automatic approval, and threaded resolution replies.
- [Upgrade Refine source](upgrade-refine-source.md) — safely build,
  fast-forward, and restart a running Refine source checkout from the UI or CLI.
- [Prepare and publish a release](semantic-release.md) — preview a semantic
  increment, prepare and review the candidate, then explicitly publish it.
- [Provision a fleet worker](provision.md) — create and verify a worker using
  provider tools while Refine owns node identity and work.
- [Distribute and converge work](distribute-and-converge.md) — move Goals to
  workers and bring reviewable work home.
- [Migrate Gap state to Goals](migrate-gap-state.md) — preserve intent through
  the agent-operated schema migration.
- [Migrate a Refine v2 project to current v4](v2-to-v4-migration-runbook.md) —
  preserve legacy durable state and node-local evidence in the current v4
  layout and isolated state branch.
- [Migrate a node to the scale and reliability layout](../spec/scale-reliability-performance.migration.md)
  — relocate node-local logs, retire derived state, and restore host-governed
  concurrency after upgrading an existing v4 node.

Conventions: commands are shown as `refine …`; inside a source checkout use
`./r …`, which is the same surface. Use `--dry-run` only when a command's CLI
entry documents it. Currently, use dry-run before `cluster distribute` and
`cluster bootstrap`; do not invent a dry-run flag for transfer, enable/disable,
maintenance, or removal commands.
