# Toolbar

## Key Ideas

- **Lazy Utility Dock**: the toolbar starts empty and creates a tab only when the user asks for one.
- **Native Agent Harnesses**: agent interaction uses the configured frontier-lab CLI in a real terminal rather than a Refine-owned chat imitation.
- **Independent Agents**: every Agent command starts a distinct general-purpose agent session; agents are not coupled to Goal Agent turns or an automatic Supervisor role.
- **Shared Terminal Surface**: Terminal, Agent, Agent in Worktree, Planing Agent, Goal, and Standalone use one terminal renderer and backend lifecycle.
- **Reporter Utilities**: Todo List uses the selected Reporter and shared
  target-app state rather than browser storage.
- **Recoverable State**: live sessions reattach after navigation or reload without making browser storage the source of process truth.

## Purpose

The toolbar keeps supporting work close at hand without eagerly launching processes or replacing the main route. Refine orchestrates agents, workflow, and evidence, while native agent harnesses retain their conversation, tool-call, approval, and rendering UX.

The add menu appears immediately after the Toolbar label and offers:

- Agent;
- Agent in Worktree;
- System;
- Files;
- Todo List;
- Terminal;
- Planing Agent.

Each selection creates or opens only the requested surface. Repeated Agent selections create independent sessions with unique labels such as Agent, Agent 2, and Agent 3. Agent in Worktree and Standalone use isolated Refine worktrees. Goal tabs attach to the workflow-owned Goal Agent already implementing that Goal and never launch a duplicate.

## Lifecycle

- a fresh app session starts with no permanent tabs and no active process;
- a page refresh restores that browser session's explicitly opened tabs and
  verifies their process state;
- each tab has a close action;
- closing an interactive terminal removes its browser tab immediately and asks
  the backend to stop its managed process without waiting for termination or
  workflow settlement;
- a tab whose process already exited or no longer exists closes locally without
  requiring a successful stop request;
- closing a Goal Agent tab uses the supported backend stop path, which preserves
  workflow claim settlement, worktree and branch retention, Goal requeue, and audit
  semantics after the browser surface detaches;
- when an explicit Stop is already in progress, closing its tab only detaches
  the browser surface and never sends a duplicate Stop; the original
  workflow-aware stop settlement continues and any late failure remains visible;
- stopping an agent keeps the rest of the Toolbar interactive, and an
  authoritative terminal-exit event releases the terminal UI even while
  workflow stop settlement is still finishing;
- when explicit cancellation already won, Stop reports the terminal cancelled
  result and retained worktree evidence instead of promising that the Goal
  returned to todo;
- resizing remains continuous across terminal status and exit redraws;
- the Add menu is anchored to its Toolbar control, so it follows the collapsed,
  resized, and fullscreen Toolbar positions;
- an interrupted browser event stream is not evidence that the managed process exited;
- terminal state remains tab-specific, including process identifier, provider, current directory, output, and worktree identity;
- every Agent terminal receives the resolved active Refine executable and checkout so it can reliably use the correct CLI;
- a general Agent may investigate and answer directly, but routes requested repository changes into a complete eligible Goal rather than implementing outside the workflow;
- when continuing an unsuccessful Goal attempt, the Agent preserves its evidence and retained work, appends an actionable recovery Round, and returns the Goal to workflow eligibility through supported Refine interfaces;
- changing target apps stops live target-scoped interactive terminals before clearing project-specific browser state.
- Todo List keeps named lists in a compact rail and gives the selected list the
  rest of the workspace. Adding and completing todos are primary actions;
  completed items are visually separated, editing stays inline, and rename or
  delete controls remain available from the selected list's options menu.
  Changing the selected Reporter reloads that Reporter's lists, and explicit
  Refresh reconciles state synchronized from another Node without polling.

The former automatic and toolbar-specific Supervisor Agent is retired. Upgrade cleanup stops its legacy managed processes and removes its durable session, state, lock, capacity leases, settings, API, and toolbar entry. Refine's process supervisor remains an infrastructure capability and is not an agent profile.

## Boundary

The toolbar exposes shared backend capability. General Agents never directly
edit durable Goal state, conceal failures, approve or merge for the user,
destructively discard retained work, or begin ongoing supervision without a
request. Todo data is authoritative in
the target app's inspectable Refine state; the tab only renders and invokes the
shared todo API. The toolbar does not implement workflow transitions, duplicate
Goal ownership, agent turn scheduling, or an alternate conversation protocol.

Future versions may add fleet-level views for active claims, pending approvals, process health, Goal evidence, and multiple native agents while retaining lazy creation and explicit lifecycle ownership.
