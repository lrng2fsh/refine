# Browser Agent Interaction

## Key Ideas

- **Harness Native**: the browser embeds real terminal sessions running the configured agent CLI instead of maintaining a custom chat transcript and input protocol.
- **Context Through Launch**: Supervisor, Plan Mode, Goal, and Standalone inject concise role and work context when the native agent starts.
- **One Terminal Primitive**: agent profiles reuse the same PTY, streaming, resize, and managed-process implementation as the plain Terminal tab.
- **Durable Work Outside Conversation**: Goals, Features, rounds, logs, governance, and workflow remain Refine state; a terminal transcript is not product truth.
- **Managed Lifecycle**: selecting a stopped agent tab starts it automatically; users can still stop and restart the managed process.

## Purpose

The browser agent surface lets users work with frontier agent harnesses without leaving Refine's orchestration context. Refine supplies the target app, role, Goal or Feature context, and isolated worktree where appropriate. The native CLI owns conversation UX, tools, approvals, and provider-specific capabilities.

Agent harnesses launch with their provider's full-access permission mode, matching Refine's background agents. This suppresses provider approval prompts without expanding the agent's Refine governance authority.

This removes Refine's former custom browser chat UI from Supervisor, Plan Mode, Goal, and Standalone tabs. The backend chat capability may still support automated workflow or non-browser adapters, but it does not define the toolbar interaction model.

## Expected Role

- Supervisor starts a configured agent prepared to observe and help with the active Refine workflow.
- Agent starts a general configured agent that may inspect repository and Refine evidence and answer conversationally. Implementation requests become complete eligible Refine Goals; the general session does not make repository changes outside the workflow. Recovery preserves unsuccessful attempts and adds a new actionable Round before returning the Goal to workflow eligibility through supported interfaces.
- Plan Mode starts a configured agent prepared to explore a feature or Goal plan and use Refine's CLI to persist selected work.
- Goal opens the configured agent that the workflow already started with fresh
  durable Goal and Round context.
- Standalone starts a configured agent inside an isolated, reusable worktree.

Browser persistence is limited to what is needed to reconnect the terminal: its managed process/session identity, profile metadata, provider, working directory, and standalone worktree. Refine does not parse a native harness transcript to infer durable work. The agent or user creates and changes Refine work through the existing CLI, API, or product surfaces.

Goal differs from the other profiles in ownership. The workflow starts one Goal
Agent per active Goal, and Open Agent only attaches to it. Browser activation
must not create a second Goal agent. Supervisor, Plan Mode, and Standalone remain
role singletons.

On reload, the browser checks the persisted terminal session against the daemon before deciding whether to show Restart. Event-stream connectivity and process liveness are separate: a transient SSE interruption reconnects to the existing PTY and cannot mark the managed process exited.

## Future Direction

New agent harness features should normally arrive through the configured CLI rather than by adding parallel browser controls. Refine's browser work should focus on fleet visibility, context routing, safe process lifecycle, worktree ownership, and durable workflow handoff.
